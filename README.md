# pharmacy_study

Work in progress project using public information about pharmacies in Navarra (north spanish province) and different Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Geopandas
- Networkx
- Osmnx

I am coding a solution to answer two questions:
- Where can I open a new pharmacy (local law requires a minimum distance of 150 metres from the closest pharmacy)
- Where should I open a new pharmacy (based on different parameters: population, income, age)
